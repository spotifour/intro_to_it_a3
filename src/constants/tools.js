  "We used two GitHub repositories in this project, one for managing our general work and one for the code of our websites:",
  "The first repository consists of 3 folders: code, images, and text. First, the code folder was used for each member to push some small chunks of code in order to use them later when developing the website. Next, the images folder helped store all the images that we would use on our websites. Lastly, the text folder was the place to store all the text for the report of our assignment. For simplicity and faster workflow, we only used one main branch for this repository. It helps us keep all the resources we need for this project well-organized and safe in a place where we can refer back at any moment.",
  "The second repository was used to store the code for our website. We modified and added all the code collected from the first repository to this repository. Git and GitHub allowed us to make changes to our code and easily push them to the remote repository and minimize conflicts during development. Moreover, there was a time we had a problem deploying the website after adding certain features; Git helped us to revert to older commits and continue our work from there, saving us a ton of time.",
  "GitHubâ€™s log activity: When a member finished coding a feature or writing a section in the report, he would push them directly to GitHub on the main branch."
