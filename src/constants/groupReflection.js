      "I believe that all of the members did their job great. I have had a great teamwork experience with every member. Although I did face many challenges and difficulties, I have always had my teammates alongside me every time I needed help. I can tell that every team member has done their best for the assignment, and it is the thing that matters. With the unity of the whole group, the report for assignment 3 was fascinating. However, I suppose that our project idea can be developed even more. We all had so many ideas to put in the project, but we did not have enough time to go for it. Nevertheless, it also taught me a lesson about planning and scheduling my work. When I work in a team, it is totally different from working individually. It requires me to manage my work and time appropriately. One thing that surprised me is that I have never thought a project report could be this complicated. There were so many more problems that needed to be addressed when it came to writing a report than I had ever thought.",

      "In assignment 3 of introduction to information technology, I would say that, overall, my team has worked together quite well and effectively. Minh, our team supervisor, has found a new way of managing our teamwork with the Gantt chart via Asana. I am also really amazed by his exceptional writing skill and ability to develop new ideas. Linh, in the meantime, demonstrated his broad understanding of web development. He also checked my work carefully, provided helpful comments, and helped me a lot in different sections. Huynh has brought me lots of useful knowledge about the IT field. In addition, he always listened to our comments carefully to build such well-designed PowerPoint slides.",
      "Looking at the upcoming courses and projects, there are some parts that our team needs to enhance. One of them is communication. Because of the pandemic, some team members could not attend the campus. Even though having an online call is the solution, it still could not be as effective as a face-to-face meeting. Another problem is that some sections that we did may have some similarities in ideas, so next time, it would be better if our team built a more specific plan.",

      "Minh is the group supervisor, as he pointed out all the tasks required for this assignment and assigned them to each member. He has demonstrated that he is a very hard-working and detailed-oriented person. Huynh has surprised me with his slides-making skills. He is always enthusiastic and be ready to help other members. Finally, Hoang blew me away with his design talent; he is very passionate about this project and always came up with ideas to improve it. I learned a lot from them throughout this experience and have developed my time management and communication skills a lot.",
      "However, I can see that there are some aspects that we need to improve for future projects. The first one is writing. I felt that we had spent more time on the report than expected. Next time, I think it is better if we have a clear structure of what we want to write before starting our work. Moreover, since the upcoming courses will have more complex projects, I hope that other members will continue improving their skills in web development, Git and GitHub.",
      "In conclusion, the process of making assignment 3 has improved me a lot and helped me realize parts I need to continue developing in the future."

      "Our group did not make some minor mistakes in assignment 2 as before. Although team members were not so professional in using Git and GitHub, we were much better at managing our code and collaborating with one another. We can now handle any basic programming conflicts that might arise adequately. In terms of myself, I became more organized and paid more attention to the details. I developed the habit of proofreading after finishing my writing to ensure that there were no grammatical errors and the content was clearly described for readers to grasp. I am also used to working with a new code editor - VSCode. It was much more convenient than PyCharm (the code editor I used before) and allowed me to program with various languages. In addition, this was my first time serving as the team's supervisor. I assigned tasks, managed other people's work, and provided constructive feedback. Despite several difficulties when undertaking this new role, I now have a basic understanding of a programmer's working style and how to collaborate in an IT team. They were invaluable experiences that will help me do other advanced projects in the future.",

      "Our team has been working together for both assignment 2 and assignment 3 since week 5. Collaborating in two months allows us to gain a better understanding of each team member. One surprising fact we discovered is that Tuan Linh had experience working in an IT company before, so he is pretty familiar with various IT tools and technologies. Quoc Huynh and Thai Hoang are passionate about not only technologies but also several art forms. They are both highly creative, and they did a fantastic job in creating illustrations and making PowerPoint slides for the project. On the other hand, Hoang Minh had leadership experience from participating in various extracurricular activities, which was really useful when managing the team’s working processes.",
      "In terms of the group project, we worked more effectively than when we did for assignment 2. We became more organized and structured. We divided a large amount of work of assignment three into small tasks and then assigned them to each member appropriately.",
      "According to the data from the “Asana” application, we assigned 29 small tasks in total, and each member was responsible for 6-8 tasks.",
      `Furthermore, team member communication was excellent, which was the critical aspect of our projects' success. We connected outside of class on a regular basis, and even over the Christmas vacation week, we met online through the "Google Meet" application to discuss project ideas.`,
      `Although our team performed exceptionally well in this assignment, there were still a few areas we needed to improve. We could not create a prototype of our project due to limited time and knowledge. Our IT project required us to have extensive website development knowledge, both in front-end and back-end technologies. In the future, we should strengthen our knowledge more in that area, so we can develop our desired website application and make it available to all Internet users. Another aspect that needs to be improved is keeping track of work progress. A few tasks, such as "Plans and Progress", were completed later than expected, causing some workflow delays. This might not have a significant impact on us in this assignment, but we will need to overcome it in the future when working on larger projects with limited time.`,
